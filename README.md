# AutoCli

Are you sick of writing long and annoying argparse initialization code?
Worry no more - the future is here!

# IDEAS!

- Adding shorthands for optional parameters.
- Debug and logging level flags!
- Custom functions for creating parameters!
- Settings for exclusive groupings?
- Limiting options for parameters (An argument which can have only X predetermined values)
- Storing reusable configuration in user directory
- Having the script hosted as an HTTP service
- Interactive mode!

# Notes

Add recommendation to registration func to not provide defaults for dict controlled arguments
Also, when providing a dict setter, make sure that parameter names are indicative.
